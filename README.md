<h1>Code-Doctor: Full Stack Next.js App</h1>

<p>Code-Doctor is a full-stack web application developed. The application aims to provide a platform for users to submit their mail data, and get added to the waitlist by storing the validated data in a database. The project is implemented using various technologies, including Next.js, React, TypeScript, Express.js, MongoDB, and Framer Motion for animations.</p>

<h2>Frontend</h2>

<p>The front end of the application is built using Next.js, a React framework that offers server-side rendering and improved performance. TypeScript is incorporated into the project for better type safety and an enhanced developer experience. The design of the front is based on the provided Figma design, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Next.js with TypeScript:</strong> The frontend is created as a Next.js project with TypeScript support, enabling the development of robust and type-safe code.</li>
  <li><strong>Framer Motion:</strong> Framer Motion is utilized to add creative animations and smooth transitions, enhancing the overall user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Image Optimization:</strong> To improve loading times, the images used in the application are optimized.</li>
  <!-- Add more frontend features if applicable -->
</ul>

<h2>Backend</h2>

<p>The backend of the application is built using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework. It serves as the server and handles incoming API requests. The chosen database for storing mail data is MongoDB, which provides scalability and flexibility for data storage.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Express.js with MongoDB:</strong> The backend is implemented using Express.js, and the mail data is stored in MongoDB for efficient data management.</li>
  <li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong> The backend provides API endpoints to handle incoming form submissions and validate the data before storing it.</li>
  <li><strong>Server App Port:</strong> The backend server app is running on port 5000.</li>
  <!-- Add more backend features if applicable -->
</ul>
